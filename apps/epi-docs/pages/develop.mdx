# Developer Guide

## Current Prototype

We have moved quickly to investigate alternative stacks.
This is our progress so far

- We have implemented a monorepo (turbo) - which gives us orchestration and operational caching
- We have an initial CI (GitHub Actions)
- We have an initial CD (Google Cloud Build)
  - Cloud Run for compute
  - Cloud SQL for the Postgres instance
- We have a previous CD (Vercel) - with preview-deployments
  - Serverless Database (with forks) - Neon
- ORM model (Prisma) - synchronized on Chris' unmodified schema

## History

Chris has been experimenting since at least Feb 2023.
His [repo](https://github.com/ToferC/epi_center) is written in rust.
It uses the `actix` framework, and `diesel for the orm`

He has a burgeoning [frontend](https://github.com/ToferC/epifront) repo for the frontend.
It uses
It is a static site authored in rust. The javascript is using `jquery, jquery-ui, and bootstrap`
