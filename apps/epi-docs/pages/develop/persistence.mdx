We are using prisma. Wea re also using some porthos plugins to facilitate building the GraphQL schema.

Here is a great tutorial on [Building a fullstack app using TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Next.js, GraphQL and Prisma
](https://www.prisma.io/blog/series/fullstack-nextjs-and-graphql-md1tczpfz1)

## Database

Currently deployed to a serverless Potsgres instance (Neon). It supports live branching of the database, for staging and preview deploys.

## Database Model

We are currently mirroring the original database model from Chris' POC. written in Rust using `diesel` ORM.
