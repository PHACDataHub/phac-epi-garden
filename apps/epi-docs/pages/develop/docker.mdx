# Docker

- Containerizing both our apps
- Can we re-use a single Dockerfile for multiple builds (using ARG)

## Containerization

To deploy to GCP Cloud Run, our app(s) need to be containerized.

We wish to have dev/prod parity on building the containers, so this process must also run locally.

There is a top level `docker-compose.yaml` file which refers to each of the apps, with their own Dockerfile.
For now these Dockerfiles are almost but not comlpetely identical, due to some differences between the two apps.
Both apps are next.js, but `epi-t3` has more complex dependencies (i.e. shared monorepo packages like `packages/{db,auth}`)

### Dockerfile

We are using multi-stage builds in the `Dockerfile`s, whi;s objectives are multiple

- Keep the Dockerfiles as similar as possible, controling some if their behavior with `ARG`s (docker build time environment variables)
- Keep docker build fast, by maximizing caching (a common technique)
- Make the final production image as small as possible.

Because we are in a `turbo` monorepo, and apps are not isolated to a single directory,
they reference their library dependencies (like `packages/{api,auth,config,db}`).
This makes it necessary to invoke the Dockerfile with the root of the repositry as the context.

Luckily, `turbo` has a command to help: `turbo prune --scope=@phac/${APP_NAME} --docker`, which extracts the parts of the repository that an app needs, based on it's dependencies.
This is actually what we use as the root context for building.
This command is actually executed inside the `builder` stage of the docker build, and so `docker build` actually uses th repository root as it;s build context.

We will comment the parts (and differences) between the Dockerfiles as we evolve and converge the build process.
