# System Considerations

On the road from prototype to product!

I wish that the experience of building a rapid prototype yields two outcomes:

- Capturing the excitement and energy of _blue sky thinking_, and the _art of the possible_
- A sober sense of the long term and sustained commitment that is required to bring such a system to production.

While the leap might seem significant,
it's crucial to remember that each step on this path
provides us with a unique learning opportunity, a chance to innovate, collaborate
and build something truly fit for purpose.

The topics listed below are not hurdles but stepping stones towards
a mature, robust system. Each deserves thoughtful consideration with **all** stakeholders.

- **Business Alignment**: Aligning the system design with business goals and
  strategies.
- **User Experience**: Ensuring an intuitive, user-friendly system that boosts
  user satisfaction and adoption.
- **Security**: Prioritizing data privacy and system security to protect against
  breaches and meet regulatory requirements.
- **Data Governance and Integrity**: Guaranteeing reliable, accurate, and
  consistent data over its entire lifecycle.
- **Privacy Compliance**: Adhering to relevant regulations (such as Protected B).
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meeting necessary standards, like accessibility and
  internationalization.
- **Disaster Recovery / Business Continuity Planning**: Ensuring the system can
  quickly recover and maintain continuity of operation in the event of a disaster.
- **Performance**: Building a system capable of handling an appropriate volume
  transactions efficiently, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- **Observability**: Implementing robust monitoring, logging, and tracing to ensure
  system health and performance can be effectively tracked and issues swiftly identified.
- **Cost-Efficiency**: Implementing strategies that optimize resources and
  reduce unnecessary expenses.
- **Scalability**: Designing a system that can efficiently scale to handle
  increasing data or user traffic.
- **Maintainability**: Building a system that can be efficiently maintained and
  updated over time.
- **Adaptability**: Ensuring that the system can adapt to changing business
  needs and technological advancements.
- **Interoperability**: Designing the system to interact seamlessly with existing
  or future systems.
