# Planning

This is a high level planning document for discussions, until we have a common place for Tasks/Issues.

This only covers the implementation aspects of the project.

- Resolve Project Name : epicenter/epicentre
  - In general do we adopt canadian spelling
  - How much i18n do we include for demo
- Authentication / Authorization
  - Currently using discord
  - No authorization, except POC for logged in state.
  - select a final authentication authority
  - what is required for demo
- Move the GitHub repo to `https://github.com/PHACDataHub/phac-epi-garden`
  - The repo has been created but the CI/CD has not been moved.
    - will we keep vercel deployments for demo, if so which domain name
- GraphQL
  - Data is being transported to client using TRPC
    - For developer, this has similar expressivity, and enforces type safety from schema, to front end code.
  - Initial implementation of GraphQL endpoint has been done with a single entity, to de risk
- Review Database Model
  - Canonical names for database entities/fields
    - naming conventions: pluralization/case need to be validated
  - Documentation
    - Each entity and relation should be documented to describe it's intent and invariants
    - e.g. root of org_tiers, relation ro tier_level
- GCP deployments
- Testing
  - Has not started
  - Unit testing (jest/react testing library)
  - End-to-end (cypress/playwright)

## Specific Issues

### Deploy to GCP

- Obtain a domain name or zone (\*.epicenter.phac.alpha.canada.ca)
  - this name cannot be used on vercel
- Docker container build
- Deploy to Cloud Run
  - No (CloudRun) Domain mapping support in canada
  - Alternative: deploy to US Region
  - Alternative: Manually create:
    - Load Balancer / Endpoints / certificates / etc...

### Preview deployments

Adjust CI/CD and neon integration to preserve preview deploys (feature branches).
This seems to be related to vercel/neon integration.

### Org Chart

D3, although a fantastic visualization library has a fundamentally different way of treating state dynamics,
and is always a challenge to integrate with React.

This component should be replaced.

The org_tier/person chart (d3), has unresolved peer dependencies.

- d3 is locked to a very old version. The peer deps from the chart we imported specify `"d3": ">= 3.x < 4"`

```txt
  "@unicef/react-org-chart": "^0.3.4",
  "d3": "^3.5.17",
  "react-organizational-chart": "^2.2.1",
```
