# Planning

This is a high level planning document for discussions, until we have a common place for Tasks/Issues.

This only covers the implementation aspects of the project.

- Resolve Project Name : epicenter/epicentre
  - In general do we adopt canadian spelling
  - How much i18n do we include for demo
- Authentication / Authorization
  - Currently using discord
  - No authorization, except POC for logged in state.
  - select a final authentication authority
  - what is required for demo
- Move the Gihub repo to `https://github.com/PHACDataHub/phac-epi-garden`
  - The repo has been created but the CI/CD has not been moved.
    - will we keep vercel deployments for demo, if so which domain name
- GraphQL
  - Data is being transported to client using TRPC
    - For developer, this has similar expressivity, and enforces type safety from schema, to front end code.
  - Initial implmentation of GraphQL endpoint has been done with a single entity, to de risk
- Review Database Model
  - Canonical names for database entities/fields
    - naming conventions: pluralization/case need to be validated
  - Documentation
    - Each entity and relation should be documented to descibe it's intent and invariants
    - e.g. root of org_tiers, relation ro tier_level
- GCP deployments
- Testing
  - Has not started
  - Unit testing (jest/react testing library)
  - End-to-end (cypress/playwright)

## Specific Issues

### Deploy to GCP

- Obtain a domain name or zone (\*.epicenter.phac.alpha.canada.ca)
  - this name cannot be used on vercel
- Docker container build
- Deploy to Cloud Run
  - No (CloudRun) Domain mapping support in canada
  - Alternative: deploy to US Region
  - Alternative: Manually create:
    - Load Balancer / Endpoints / certificates / etc...

### Preview deployments

Adjust CI/CD and neon integration to preseve preview deploys (feature branches).
This seems to be related to vercel/neon integration.

### Org Chart

The rapid implementation required an extra div in `_app.tsx`; this should be removed

```jsx
<Layout>
  {/* required by react-org-chart */}
  <div id="root">
    <Component {...pageProps} />
  </div>
</Layout>
```

The org_tier/person chart (d3), has unresolved peer dependencies.

- d3 is locked to a very old version

```txt
+    "d3": "^3.5.17",
+    "lodash": "^4.17.21",
+    "react-dnd": "^16.0.1",
+    "react-dnd-html5-backend": "^16.0.1",
+    "react-organizational-chart": "^2.2.1",
```
