# Project Logo

import Image from "next/image";

<div
  style={{ display: "flex", alignItems: "center", justifyContent: "center" }}
>
  <Image src="/images/epi-logo.svg" alt="Epi-Logo" width={200} height={200} />
</div>

There a many ways to use our logo, which was also meant to show flexible uses of SVG in the context of a React application.

In this first instance we refer to the image in a file (`/images/epi-logo.svg`)
and use the `next/image` component to render it.

```jsx
import Image from "next/image";

<Image src="/images/epi-logo.svg" alt="Epi Logo" width={200} height={200} />;
```

---

### Component

import { Logo, LogoVariant } from "../../components/logo";

<Logo />
Here we invoke it from a react component, which has the same content as the svg file,
but contained in a tsx fragment

```jsx
import { Logo } from "../../components/logo";

<Logo />;
```

### Variants

Finally, we see that having the logo in a component allows us to use it in different ways.
Including variants, calculations based on props, and even animate the content:

import { Tab, Tabs } from "nextra-theme-docs";

<Tabs items={["Pulsing (Default)", "Simple", "Spinner"]}>
  <Tab>
    <LogoVariant />

    ```jsx
    import {LogoVariant} from "../../components/logo";

    // default variant is "pulsing", so the property could be omitted
    <LogoVariant />
    // is equivalent to
    <LogoVariant variant="pulsing"/>
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    <LogoVariant variant="simple" />

    ```jsx
    import {LogoVariant} from "../../components/logo";

    <LogoVariant variant="simple" />
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    <LogoVariant variant="spinner" animate={true}/>

    ```jsx
    import {LogoVariant} from "../../components/logo";

    <LogoVariant variant="spinner" animate={true}/>
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    <LogoVariant />

    ```jsx
    import {LogoVariant} from "../../components/logo";
    // default variant
    <LogoVariant />
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>
